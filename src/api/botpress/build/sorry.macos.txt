I’m so sorry you have to read this! We’re aware of the bad experience you’re about to face. Trust me, we’re working on fixing it.

To get Botpress running on macOS for the 1st time, you need to open the System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and keep that screen open for the next steps.

0 - control + click the binary, choose open
1 - An alert will pop on your face, "macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware". Click Cancel
2 - A message will appear in your Security & Privacy > General screen
3 - Click Allow Anyway
4 - Kill the process
5 - Double click the binary
6 - A new alert will pop up "By opening this app, you will be overriding system Security .... ". Click Open
7 - Repeat steps 1 - 6 until "Botpress is exposed at http://localhost:3000" in the terminal

You'll see, this is worth it.
Sorry again!
