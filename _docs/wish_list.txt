Bears will be doing reports

[a] Schema for "applications" table

app_id, app_name, app_version, app_status, is_eol

app_status:
--> Open (default)
--> Approved 

is_eol
--> false(default)
--> true  

[b] Schema for 'ownership'

app_name (primary key), app_type, foss_contact, app_owner, team_name, ownership_type, owning_bu

app_name:
* same as the app_name in "applications" table. 
* It is assumed that all versions of an application are owned by only one owner/team

app_type  
-> red (default)
--> yellow
--> red_n_yellow

foss_contact
--> email

app_owner
--> email

team_name
--> string

ownership_type
--> application (default)
--> component


owing_bu:
--> internal (default)
--> external

[c] Example: Ownership --> Ownership

Applications (RED and YELLOW) are owned.
Components (GREEN) are requested in applications.

Who owns a component? Depends on where it is being requested.

Enhancements to "Applications" table:
Show additional columns

========= Site Map =========

Add "Search" before Releases
Search:
    * User can type "where some_name" (default) or "who some_name"  to find out who owns a component or where it is being used.
    * May be enhanced to support other searches later.

Add "Ownership" before the setup
Ownership:
    * it will not have any left hand side
    * we will show just the JQuery data table on the "ownership" table
    * We support CRUD operations on the "Ownership"

Reports:
    Note: All of these reports are applicable to "SYSTEM BOMs" only.
    * Reports - Location    (need input)
    * FOSS Count     (what is FOSS?)
    * Unique FOSS List     (what is FOSS?)
    * Duplicate Versions
    * Multiple Versions
    * Reports - Ownership    (need input)
